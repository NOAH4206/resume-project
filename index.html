            <h2>About Me:</h2>

            <p>
                My name is Matthew Gross.
                <br />
                I was born in Connecticut, but moved to South Florida when I
                entered Kindergarten and have lived here ever since. I graduated
                from Broward College with a teaching degree in 2019. This is my
                fifth year teaching Engineering at Taravella High School, and I
                am excited to welcome you all to our wonderful community.
                <br />
                Outside of teaching, I am a giant nerd and love to play video
                games, Dungeons & Dragons, and board games. I also enjoy
                woodworking, computer programming, and painting in watercolors.
